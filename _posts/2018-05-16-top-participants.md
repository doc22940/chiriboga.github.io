# {{ page.title }}
A Wordpress Plugin for showing top participants, teams and groups from the Luminate API.  For information on thhe plugin or on how to lease the plugin for your website [contact me](mailto://richardchiriboga@gmail.com) today.



## Description
Finally an easy way to show your Blackbaud Luminate Online Top Participants information on your wordpress website.  You can add your top participants, teams and custom participant types using shortcodes. Plugin uses Luminate Online’s API to safely grab that information and give you the power to show it as you wish!



## Example Usage
`[top_participants 
	type="XXXX" 
	output="XXXX" 
	class="XXXX" 
	event_id="XXXX" 
	limit="XXXX" 
	title="XXXX" 
	filter_text="XXXX"]`



## Default Arguments
- **type** = participants | teams | crew
- **output** = table | list
- **class** = "whatever you want it to be"  
- **id** = "whatever you want it to be  
- **event_id** = fr_id  
- **filter_text** = the "participant type" inside your Teamraiser for a particular event (ONLY FOR CREW)
- **limit** = <10 (apparently their API ONLY gives you up to 10) 
- **title** = "whatever you want it to be and gets wrapped in an h2 with the class of "type"_header so IE: participants_header
